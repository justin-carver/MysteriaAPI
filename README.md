# MysteriaAPI
The Mysteria API is the direct connection open-source API for the digital "MMOAPI" *Mysteria*, a fictional digital fantasy realm composed of API calls. An MMOAPI is a **simulation** of a true massively multiplayer online game, similar to World of Warcraft or Runescape. **This is not real player information**. 

## The Quest
This project is the culmination of using Express, Node, and other APIs to generate a seemingly realistic simulated online environment, similar to that of a video-game mmo, that can be requested via API. This API is to go on to serve as the foundation of future projects and challenges to be used with the public, who can generate these requests at will, or locally on their own system with Node.js installed.

## The Adventure
There are various properties that can be extracted from this, please consult the list below: 

## //TODOs:
- [ ] Make successful GET requests against server.
- [ ] Implement [yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) for more complex world generation or queries.
