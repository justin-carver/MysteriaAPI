# MysteriaAPI
The Mysteria API is the direct connection open-source API for the digital "MMOAPI" *Mysteria*, a fictional digital fantasy realm composed of API calls. An MMOAPI is a **simulation** of a true massively multiplayer online game, similar to World of Warcraft or Runescape. **This project does not contain any real player information**. 

## The Quest
This project is the culmination of using Express, Node, and other APIs to generate a seemingly realistic simulated online environment, similar to that of a video-game mmo, that can be requested via API. This API is to go on to serve as the foundation of future projects and challenges to be used with the public, who can generate these requests at will, or locally on their own system with Node.js installed.

## The Adventure
There are various properties that can be extracted from this, please consult the list below: 

## //TODOs:
- [ ] Make successful GET requests against server.
- [ ] Migrate generated instance information to MongoDB.
- [ ] Implement [yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) for more complex world generation or queries.

## Learning
While I am making this project free and open-source, this is also a learning experience for myself with regards to server-side JavaScript, HTTP requests, APIs, and many more. The list below represents core ideas that I have worked upon to further my education within this project:
- API Creation / Queries
- HTTP Requests
- Express
- Node
- JSDoc / Technical Documentation
- JSON Manipulation
- State Machines
- GitHub Copilot*

### Contributions
This project has been made with love by Justin Carver. PR's welcome! All licenses by original owners and authors remain in place. The **log.txt** file within the */logs* folder shows a detailed output of the self-hosted server initialization process.

#### *GitHub Copilot
Every piece of logic and code was written by me, but I spent some time with the GitHub Copilot beta coming up with ways to generate unique data structures or write functions templates much more quickly than I can. Unfortunately due to it's rough beta state, it can only do so much.
